# Data Visualization Methods for Improving the Identifiaction and Examination of Fraudulent Transactions in Online Payment Platforms

The growing number of online payment transactions has resulted in a parallel
increase in fraudulent activities, and thus there is a critical need for efficient
detection mechanisms. This project explores the use of a combination of data
visualization methods to improve the detection and
analysis of fraud in online payment systems. The central idea is that the visualization
of complex transaction data sets can uncover patterns and anomalies that
may be hidden in conventional data formats, thus enhancing the capacity to detect
fraudulent activity.
